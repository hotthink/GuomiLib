This resporitory includes an independent implementation of Guomi algorithms, including SM2(Elliptic Curve Cryptography), 
SM3(256-bit hash) and SM4(128-bit-block symmetric encryption).
We're going to do more improvement, mainly on the elliptic curve operation in SM2.
We'll also add other crypto methods which could be applied in blockchain to this resporitory.
